<!--- # CS 8501 Advanced Topics in Machine Learning --->

This is a research-oriented seminar. The goal is to learn machine learning by reading and discussing some important papers together. The tentative topics that will be covered in this course

- Bayesian machine learning
- Monte Carlo inference
- Variational inference
- Gaussian processes
- Deep neural networks
- Bayesian neural networks
- Variational autoencoders
- Generative adversarial networks
- Large-scale pretrained neural networks
